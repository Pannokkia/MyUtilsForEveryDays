# MyUtilsForEveryDays

Small collection of utilities that I often use during my working days to automate boring jobs if done manually :-)
I hope they will be useful to others too. If you have any suggestions on how to improve the code I wrote don't hesitate to tell me.
The code is written for Python 3.
